# 🏙️ Urban Waste Management System

A data-driven solution for efficient waste tracking, supply chain optimization, and responsible redistribution of excess resources—powered by **Streamlit** and **SQL**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The Urban Waste Management System aims to streamline and modernize the handling of urban waste by:

- Analyzing waste data using SQL and Python
- Managing inventory levels across various city sectors
- Applying optimization techniques to reduce wastage in the supply chain
- Forecasting future waste generation trends
- Providing actionable insights for handling excess materials
- Connecting surplus items to charities and donation centers

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📊 **Real-Time Analysis** of waste generation and disposal data
- 🏬 **Inventory Management** to monitor and regulate resources
- 📦 **Supply Chain Optimization** using ML models
- 💡 **Smart Insights** on inefficiencies and bottlenecks
- 🗑️ **Wastage Handling** with suggested actions (recycle, donate, etc.)
- ❤️ **Charity & Donation Module** to route usable waste or surplus to verified organizations
- 🌐 **Mumbai City Case Study** for regional analysis and implementation

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** – for building interactive dashboards
- **SQL** – for managing and querying waste data
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** – for ML forecasting models
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Python Scripts** – modular architecture for clean flow

---

## 📂 Project Flow

Run the scripts in the following order to ensure the proper functioning of the system:

1. `Analysis.py` – Ingests and analyzes raw waste data
2. `forecast.py` – Predicts future waste trends using trained ML models
3. `charity.py` – Connects waste items to donation centers and charities
4. `mumbai.py` – Specific analysis and visualization for Mumbai
5. `insight.py` – Extracts and visualizes key insights from waste data
6. `train.py` – Trains the ML models used in forecasting
7. `mlmodel.py` – Contains the model pipeline used in forecasting
8. `core.py` – Main logic and utility functions used across the system

---

## 🔄 Handling Wastage

The system automatically detects waste surpluses. Based on type and usability:
- **Recyclable items** are flagged for processing
- **Usable goods** are directed to partnered **charity organizations**
- **Organic waste** is suggested for compost or energy generation

---

## ❤️ Charity Integration

Built-in charity matching engine:
- Lists verified NGOs and donation centers
- Tracks what’s donated, where, and when
- Helps close the loop on the waste-to-useful-path pipeline

---

## 📌 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-waste-management.git
   cd urban-waste-management

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app (assuming `core.py` is the entry point):

   ```bash
   streamlit run core.py
   ```

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add real-time IoT sensor data integration
* Geo-tagging for tracking waste collection points
* Blockchain-based verification of donations
